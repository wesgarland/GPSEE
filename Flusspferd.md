# Introduction #

Flusspferd: Javascript bindings for C++, a Javascript interpreter and shell, and a Javascript/C++ module system. Also, Flusspferd includes a few Javascript classes and modules: binary blobs, SQLite 3, GMP and others. It is designed to support easy embedding of Javascript in C++ - and vice versa. It supports Spidermonkey as its backend, and possibly support for other engines will be added later. Read the latest News on Flusspferd or follow us on Twitter.
