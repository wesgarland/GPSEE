This directory contains a collection of build rules and source code patches
for 3rd-party applications that use SpiderMonkey. These applications, which 
were not created as part of the GPSEE project, have been modified to compile
with GPSEE-core underpinnings.

This means that these applications can now load GPSEE modules, effectively
making them support ServerJS as well as GPSEE. 

The patches have been created as cleanly as possible, using the third-party
build system as effectively as possible, and generally acting by intercepting
JSAPI calls and replacing them with equivalent GPSEE calls.

These patches are likely to be very version sensitive. If have trouble
building, either download the version or contact the the GPSEE team.

You can verify from script that you are in fact in a GPSEE namespace. To do
this, evaluate the variable 'gpseeNamespace'.
