This directory contains the build rules necessary for building the Mozilla JS 
shell (js.cpp) with GPSEE-core underpinnings.

It builds against the same version of Spidermonkey which you configured in the 
master GPSEE build system.  It is extremely sensitive Spidermonkey library 
versions, as the JS shell actually re-compiles most of the object files, and
then some GPSEE native modules re-link with the interpreter via a DSO. This 
means that there are two copies of most functions in SpiderMonkey, and which 
gets called depends on the program linkage. It also means that you MUST not 
try and SpiderMonkey library sleight of hand with this code if you want a 
stable product.

If you are looking for a stable scripting host, and do not need the 
Mozilla-specific functions in this one, we suggest you look at gsr, the
GPSEE Script Runner.

If you are looking for a stable REPL, and do not need the Mozilla-specific
functions in this one, we suggest you look at sample_programs/repl/simple.js
under your GPSEE source tree.
