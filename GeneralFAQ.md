# What's with the Project Logo? #

SpiderMonkey is the JavaScript engine which ships with the Firefox web browser and other Mozilla products. The Project Logo, Victorian clip-art of a monkey dressed up and playing an accordion, represents the fact that GPSEE dresses up SpiderMonkey and teaches it some new tricks. But when you get right down to it, working with GPSEE means you're working with SpiderMonkey.

# What is the origin of GPSEE? #

GPSEE is the open-source spin-off of a toolkit written by PageMail, Inc. to assist in certain types of process automation and flexible run-time configuration. It has been released to the open source community in order to help grow a JavaScript ecosystem which is not limited to the web browser, or even the web server. We see this ecosystem covering all types of development and library modules, from numerical computation to text processing to web applications and beyond.

This code base was originally known as "JSEng" and "Open JSEng", however dual-stream development has been terminated in favour of a more generic approach which allows us to keep our proprietary code isolated in GPSEE native modules. This makes it much easier to propagate changes to (and accept changes from) the open source community.

# What is the CommonJS Pseudo-WG? #

This is a loosely-knit group of individuals interested in creating a standard for interoperable JavaScript hosts in and outside of the web browser. Discussions are held on the CommonJS Google Group, #commonjs on irc.freenode.org, standards and proposals are documented in the wiki at http://wiki.commonjs.org, and interoperability test suites are available on the InteroperableJS Google project page.

Two members of this group, Kris Kowal and Ihab Awad, are actively working on a securable modules proposal for TC39, the committee which standardizes future changes to ECMAScript.
