# Introduction #

JavaScript is a small, lightweight, scripting language. It is a superset of, and conformant to, ECMAScript-3, specified in ECMA-262 edition 3.

JavaScript has nothing to do with Java. Well, almost nothing. Their names both start with the same four letters.

To quote [Douglas Crockford](http://crockford.com), JavaScript is the [World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/javascript.html).  He goes on to call to JavaScript _"LISP in C's clothing"._

If you are not an expert JavaScript programmer (and even if you are), you should buy Doug's latest book - it is excellent: [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/gpsee)
