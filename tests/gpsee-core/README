This directory holds tests which test components of the core GPSEE
infrastructure.

Some tests are JavaScript programs, some must be build through the
build system that GPSEE exposes to outside-the-tree consumers.

To build these tests, the Makefile must be able to find gpsee-config.
If gpsee-config is not on your path, you will need to specify it on 
your make command line; something like:

# make GPSEE_CONFIG=/path/to/gpsee-config
